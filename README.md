# Week 1 workshop - Pair-programming and working with GitHub

In this course, you will often work on a programming task together with a partner, using a method called **pair programming**. This week's task is designed for you to try it out, and to become familiar with the workflow.

## What is pair programming?

Pair programming is a method where two people (usually) sit in front of the same computer. Each person has a specific role:
- The **driver** writes and runs the code, and is the only person allowed to do it. They explain what they do to the navigator.
- The **navigator** observes and helps the driver, spots errors in the code, gives suggestions and ideas... They are not allowed to write code.

The two programmers decide who should "drive" first, and that person takes the keyboard to start working. The other person, the navigator, watches the screen and helps the driver with the task -- without touching the mouse or keyboard.

Then, after a while, the driver passes the keyboard and mouse to the navigator, and they switch roles.

## How does it work online?

This year, unfortunately, you won't be able to sit next to your partner and to share a computer. Instead, you will use Zoom to communicate and share your screens, and GitHub to "pass the keyboard" when you switch roles.

The task this week contains detailed instructions about what to do and when, so you can have a better idea of how this works in practice. There will be less and less scaffolding in future workshops -- it will feel more natural after you've done it a few times. During pair programming workshops, we will typically ask you to switch roles every 15 minutes or so, to make sure that both you and your partner take both roles at least once.

## Working with git and GitHub

You will be working with git and GitHub throughout the course. If it seems a little intimidating just now, don't worry -- you'll become more and more comfortable with it as you practice. Here are a few useful things to know before getting started:

- **git** is a program that helps you manage programming projects. You can think of git as a sort of clerk or bookkeeper, which keeps track of all the changes you make to the files in your project.
- a **repository** is basically just a folder with some files inside, generally managed with git. It's where your programming project lives, it contains the files with all the code.
- a **repo** is just short for "repository".
- a **local repo** is a repository located on your computer's hard drive (not online).
- Whenever you "accept an assignment" using the links on Learn, a repo is created for you online on GitHub.
- When you **clone** that repo onto your computer, you download the files from the GitHub repo, and you also create a "link" (called a *remote*) from your local repo to the GitHub repo. The changes you make to these files are *only* on your computer, until you *push* them (i.e. upload them) back to the GitHub repo. We will go through that process today.

## Terminal commands

If you are using a code editor which doesn't have a git interface/menu (for example Spyder), you can use a terminal to manage git instead. You will need to type commands in the terminal and press Enter to run them.

- On Windows, use the application "Git Bash". (It should come pre-installed with git.)
- On MacOS and Linux, use your Terminal application. (It should come pre-installed with your operating system.)

For certain commands, git will ask you to type your GitHub username and password. If you don't see any characters appearing on the screen when you type your password, don't worry and keep typing, that's normal!

Here is a summary of the commands we'll use today, for reference. Replace the repo URL with the link you copy from GitHub.

| Command | Description |
|-|-|
| `git clone https://github.com/cnu-2021/cnu-w01-workshop-group-x-team-y.git` | Clones the GitHub repo in your home folder. |
| `cd cnu-w01-workshop-group-x-team-y` | Navigate to the newly created folder. |
| `git status` | Check if there are any unstaged changes. |
| `git add -A` | Stages all changes. |
| `git commit -m "My commit message"` | Commits the staged changes with the message `My commit message`. (Include the quotation marks!) |
| `git fetch origin master` | Checks with the GitHub repo to see if anyone else has pushed changes before you. |
| `git push origin master` | Pushes the committed changes to the GitHub repo. |
| `git pull origin master` | Pulls the new changes from the GitHub repo. |

## Instructions

First, decide who should be the "driver" first (you will switch roles later).

### Create your team repository on GitHub

If you made it here (following the instructions on Learn under "Workshop task"), then you probably have done this already -- congratulations! Both you and your partner are now **contributors** to the *same* GitHub repository -- you can both change the code in the repo.

The team repository you created (by accepting the assignment and creating/joining your team) lives online for the moment, on GitHub.

### Let's start coding!

- **Driver:** first of all, in Zoom, **share your screen** with your teammate, so that they can see what you do. When you code something, explain what you are doing out loud.
- **Navigator**: help the driver by reading these instructions to them, so they don't have to keep coming back here to read them all the time.

#### Driver:

- If you haven't done this already, clone the GitHub repository on your computer using VSCode. This is the same process as you did for `cnu-w01-tutorial`, but without the authentication/authorisation (since you have already done this once) If you don't remember how to do this, you can ask your **navigator** for help. To summarise:
1. Launch VSCode.
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+P (MacOS: Cmd+Shift+P) to open the Command Palette.
3. Type `clone` and click on the "Git: Clone" option.
4. Copy and paste the link from the GitHub repo into the text box, and press Enter. Select a location on your computer to put the new folder.
5. If you get a prompt on the bottom right of your screen, select "Add to workspace". This will add this new repo to the list of folders on the left pane.
6. After it has finished cloning the repo, you should now see these files in the left pane. Note that these instructions here are in the file `README.md`.

> **Terminal commands**:
> - Launch a terminal, type `git clone https://github.com/cnu-2021/cnu-w01-workshop-group-x-team-y.git`, and press Enter.
> - If prompted, type your GitHub username and press Enter, then type your GitHub password and press Enter.
> - Type `cd cnu-w01-workshop-group-x-team-y` and press Enter to navigate to the new folder.

*If you have encountered any issues so far, please call a tutor.*

- In VSCode (or in your favourite editor), open the file `hello.py`. This is a **Python script**, which you can recognise with the extension `.py`. This can only contain Python code.

- You will see that there is already some code in there. Let's try to run it: in VSCode, click on the green triangle which looks like a "play" button at the top right of your screen. You should see the *output* of the code appear in a terminal window at the bottom of the screen.

*If this doesn't work, please call a tutor.*

#### Driver & navigator:

Discuss together to figure out how the `print()` command works here. Driver, you can try to remove the `f` in front of the quote `'`, and run the code again to see what happens; you can also try changing what's inside the `{}`. Navigator, you can consult the documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#formatted-string-literals) and explain it to your driver.

#### Driver:

- On lines 1 and 2, change the variables `name` and `age` to reflect your own name and age.

- On line 3, create a new variable called `birthday`, a *string* which indicates when is your birthday. For example, if your birthday is this Sunday, `birthday` could be `'27th September'`.

- Then, after the `print()` command, add another line to print a sentence which says when is your birthday. Run all the code again, and check that it worked. If it doesn't work, ask your navigator to help you find the error.

Now, you are going to save your changes using git, and update the GitHub repo with your new code. There will be 3 steps to this process:
1. You need to first tell git that you've changed some files. This is called **staging** your changes.
2. Then, you will tell git to **commit** these changes, i.e. to save them in your local repo.
3. Finally, you will tell git to **push** the changes online to the GitHub repo, so that your collaborator can also see them.

This is what you need to do:

- Press Ctrl+s (Windows, Linux) or Cmd+s (MacOS) to save the file.

- You should now see a little blue circle with a number on the 3rd icon in the grey bar on the left of your screen (this is the "Source Control" tab). This means that git has detected that there have been changes made in the folder, but that you haven't yet informed git of these changes. Click on this icon.

- You should see the file `hello.py` under "Changes". Hover your mouse near the words "Source Control" above this, and click the `...` icon; this is the menu where you will be able to find all your git commands. Select "Changes" > "Stage All Changes". This informs git that there have been some changes to the files in the repo.

- Now, you are going to commit these changes. **Whenever you commit**, you should write a **short message** to describe what changes you've made. Type a message in the text box where it says "Message"; for example, your message could be "Added my birthday to hello.py". Then, press Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on MacOS), or click the check mark icon next to "Source Control". Committing is simply telling git to save these changes.

> **Terminal commands:**
> - Make sure you have saved the file.
> - In your terminal, make sure you are still in the folder `cnu-w01-workshop-group-x-team-y`. If not (e.g. if you have opened a new terminal), navigate to it using `cd`.
> - You can check that there are new changes by using `git status` and pressing Enter. This should list the files that have been changed.
> - To stage all changes, type `git add -A` and press Enter.
> - To commit your changes, type `git commit -m "your commit message"` and press Enter.

Your changes have now been committed to your *local* repo.

> If at this point you see an error related to git credentials or identity (e.g. "Please tell me who you are"), then git wants you to do a little bit of configuration before it lets you commit for the very first time. This is because each commit needs to be easily identifiable as coming from a specific person. This is explained in more detail [here in the git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) (in the section "Your Identity"), if you are interested. Here are the steps to solve this:

> - On Windows, launch the application "Git Bash". On MacOS and Linux, open the Terminal.
> - Type the following command and press Enter:
> `git config --global user.email "youremailaddress"`
> - Type the following command and press Enter:
> `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
> 
> Use the email address you used to register your GitHub account. For example, for me, the 2 commands would be:
>
> `git config --global user.email "charlotte.desvages@ed.ac.uk"`
> `git config --global user.name "Charlotte Desvages"`
>
> After this, you can close the terminal and try to commit again -- it should now work.

#### Navigator:

Go to the repo on GitHub, refresh the page, and check the file `hello.py` -- you should see that it hasn't changed yet.

#### Driver:

The final step is for you to **push** these files from your computer to GitHub (i.e. upload them). Click the `...` icon next to "Source Control" again, and click "Push". Wait a few seconds for this to finish.

> **Terminal commands:** type `git push origin master` and press Enter.

#### Navigator:

Refresh the page again, and check `hello.py` -- you should now see the changes.

### Time to switch roles!

Navigator, you are now the **driver**, and vice versa.

- **(New) driver**: on Zoom, share your screen. You might need to ask your navigator (the former driver) to stop sharing their screen first. Explain what you do out loud for your navigator to follow more easily.
- **(New) navigator**: you are now in charge of reading the instructions for your driver, observing what they do, and helping them when necessary.

#### Driver:

Go back to the GitHub repo, which is now updated with the latest changes.

- If you have not cloned the repo yet, go back to the first "Driver:" section, and follow the same instructions to clone it.
- If you had already cloned the repo on your computer at the start of the workshop, then go to VSCode, open the Source Control tab (third icon down on the left), click the `...` icon next to "Source Control", and click "Pull", which will download the latest changes from GitHub and update your local repo with these changes.

> **Terminal commands:** to pull the changes, in the terminal, make sure you are in the folder `cnu-w01-workshop-group-x-team-y`; if not, navigate to it using `cd`. Then, type `git pull origin master` and press Enter.

Go back to the "Explorer" tab (top icon on the left of VSCode) -- you should now see the files, including the changes that the previous driver just made. If you've had any issues with this, please call a tutor.

- Open `hello.py` and run the code yourself to check that it still works. (It should!)

- Change the values of `name`, `age`, and `birthday` to your own name, age, and birthday.

- Delete the line that prints when your birthday is.

- Write a new line to print a sentence which says that you will be one year older on your birthday. For instance, with the example values that were in the code at the beginning of the workshop, that could be something like:

> On the 27th October, I will be 37 years old.

The date and age should correspond to your own, and you are not allowed to type them or copy/paste them explicitly into the `print()` command. Run the code and check that it works.

#### Navigator:

Help your driver figure out how to do this. You can also look at the documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#formatted-string-literals). If the code doesn't work the first time, help the driver to find the error.

#### Driver:

Save the file, stage your changes, commit them, and push them to GitHub. You can ask your navigator to read you the instructions again from the previous section.

#### Navigator:

After the changes have been pushed, refresh the GitHub repo to check that this has worked -- you should see the new code there. Then, go back to VSCode in the "Source Control" tab, click `...` and then "Pull", and check that you now also have the changes in your local `hello.py` file.

## Victory!

Well done -- you now know how to pair-program, how to use git to manage your changes, and how to work collaboratively on a shared GitHub repository.

If you still have time before the end of the workshop, then please continue working like this together. You can change roles again now (don't forget to change who shares their screen), and continue adding and changing things to the code, if you want to get more practice with git. **Don't forget to stage and commit your changes regularly**, even if you are not switching roles immediately! Also, **don't forget to switch roles** at least a couple more times.

Here are some suggestions:

- Instead of changing the values of `name`, `age`, and `birthday`, change the variable names to e.g. `name_1`, `age_1`, and `birthday_1`, and add 3 new variables `name_2`, `age_2`, and `birthday_2`, so that both your names, ages, and birthdays are kept in memory. Add another command to print that information for both of you.

- Using **comparison operators** (you can't type 'True' or 'False' yourself), try to print the following:

> Is <person 1> younger than <person 2>? <True/False>

where <person 1> and <person 2> are your respective names, and <True/False> is either `True` or `False` (the Boolean value) depending on your ages. Again, no typing names or ages in the `print()` command!

- Create more variables to print information about yourselves to get to know each other a little better: where you are from, where you are currently located and what time it is there, what courses you are taking this semester... It's a bit like having a conversation using exclusively `print()` commands.

- You can also create a new Python script: in the "Explorer" tab, right-click on the name of the folder (`cnu-w01-workshop-...`), select "New File", and give it a name -- don't forget the `.py` extension. Write some code in it, run it; stage, commit, and push your changes for that new file to appear in the GitHub repo. You could create a new script like this to work together on one of the tutorial worksheet problems, for example.

- If you've been using VSCode to manage git but you are curious about the terminal commands, try them out!

## Useful tips

- If you can't decide who should be the driver first, pick the person who is currently closest to the North Pole.
- Throughout a pair programming session, the driver and the navigator should **communicate** as much as possible. For example, when typing code, the driver can explain what they want to do, talk through their thought process, ask the navigator for help; the navigator can provide feedback on the code, ask the driver to do something differently, spot mistakes and suggest corrections, consult the documentation (or other notes)...
- Today, you have used a shared GitHub repository to collaborate on a task. You also have GitHub repositories for your tutorial worksheets every week, which only belong to you -- you can (and should!) still push your local changes to GitHub. It's a very good way to keep an **online backup** of your work -- in fact, this is how you will submit your projects later on. (Your repositories are private by default.)
